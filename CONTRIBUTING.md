## First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute:busts_in_silhouette: ! 

The following is a set of steps to make sure you are not contributing about some launch which someone else is already working on. 

Lets consider you want to contribute about new launches for `AndroidKTX`:
* Search the issues for `AndroidKTX` or related terms

* If an issue does'nt already exist
	* Create one.
	* The new issue will be assigned to you with an `in-progress` label
	* Fork the repo
	* Once you have completed the update, create a pull-request, mentioning the issue
	* After merging the pull-request the issue would be closed with `conquered` tag.

* If an issue does exist, 
	* and it is `in-progress`, star or comment on it with what you would want it to include and optionally helpful links. 
	* if it is  `up-for-grabs` mention intent, and it will be assigned to you and moved to `in-progress`.
